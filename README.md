**UILabs** is an API for Spigot plugins, enabling efficient and safe custom **inventory GUIs** in Minecraft.

## Why UILabs?
- **Efficient**: UILabs is designed to be resource efficient, with minimal impact on server performance.
- **Safe**: UILabs handles all interactions with the GUI ─ you don't have to worry about players messing with your GUIs.
- **Easy to Use**: Creating GUIs with UILabs is simple and intuitive, with a clean and easy-to-understand API.
- **Lightweight**: No need to include a bunch of dependencies in your plugin, UILabs is a standalone API.
- **Open Source**: UILabs is completely open source, so you can contribute to the project and help make it better.
- **Customizable**: Customize your GUIs with to your liking, using UILabs' built-in [components](#elements) and utilities.
